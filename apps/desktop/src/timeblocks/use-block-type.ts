 * The types are read again on every change to the index, and a read can come
 * back while a write is still on its way. So a write is never cancelled: what
 * it did is said whatever has rendered since, `Added` once, and a write that
 * finds the file there because another of this hook's writes put it there is
 * no failure. Once every write for the vault has settled, it is not tried
 * again until the vault is opened again, so a file the host will not write
