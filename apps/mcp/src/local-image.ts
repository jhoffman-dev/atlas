/**
 * Reading an image the client names by its path on this computer.
 *
 * This server runs as the user, with the user's whole disk, and the client
 * asking may have no file access of its own (Claude Desktop) — or may be
 * steered by text a web page planted. Whatever the server reads, the client
 * gains. So it reads only what is plainly a picture the user put somewhere
 * pictures go: a file under one of the image folders (resolved through any
 * link), whose own extension is an image kind, whose bytes are that kind, and
 * no larger than Atlas takes. Anything else is one answer that says nothing
 * about whether the file is there.
 *
 * Atlas checks the image again as it arrives; this is the check on what the
 * server itself is willing to read. It cannot use Atlas's own rules — the
 * server may import only the API's types — so it keeps the few it needs here.
