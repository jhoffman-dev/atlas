/**
 * Putting an image into a note whatever its size, over an API whose host
 * takes at most 1 MiB per request.
 *
 * One that fits in a chunk is sent whole. A larger one is sent as an upload:
 * the first chunk is answered with an upload id, every next chunk carries it
 * at the offset the last answer ended at, and the last says so — only then
 * does Atlas check the whole image and put it in place, under the name asked
 * for, numbered when that is taken. Then, unless asked not to, the image's
 * markdown is appended to the note. Atlas checks the kind, the bytes and the
 * size, and says where it goes; this checks only what it reads from disk
 * (`local-image.ts`) and that nothing too large is sent at all.
