# ADR-0030 — Timeblocks sync two ways with one dedicated Google calendar

## Context

James timeblocks: a block on the calendar that small tasks are pushed into,
or one big task placed on the calendar itself, and a task split across
several blocks. Blocks must show on his real Google Calendar as busy, so
colleagues see them. Atlas reads ICS today (Phase 12) and writes nothing to
any calendar.

## Decision

**A `block` is a note** (`type: block`, `start`, `end`, `tasks` relation
many). It syncs to **one dedicated Google calendar** ("Atlas blocks"), made
by Atlas, as **busy** events whose title is the block's title. Atlas never
writes to any other calendar and never reads event bodies it did not write.

**OAuth lives in the host.** A desktop OAuth flow (loopback redirect, PKCE)
with the `calendar.events` scope on that calendar only where possible; the
refresh token is a Keychain secret (ADR-0017) bound to
`https://www.googleapis.com`. The webview never sees it.

**Identity is the event id, stored on the block** (`gcal_event_id`,
`gcal_etag`). Reconcile runs on a schedule and after each block write:
Atlas-side changes push; Google-side time changes pull into the block; a
change on both sides since the last sync keeps Google's time and records the
conflict in Activity. An event deleted in Google marks the block
`gcal_missing: true` (ADR-0012 style), never deletes the note. Sync is
incremental (`syncToken`), so a reconcile is one cheap request.

## Consequences

- One more secret and one more outbound site; the host's binding rules apply.
- Works with the Mac awake only; blocks made on another Mac sync from the
  automations Mac.
- Google Workspace admin policy may forbid a third-party OAuth client on a
  work account — an open question to check before building.

The block model and its scheduling rules, which sync builds on:

- **The Block type** has `start` and `end` (dates with a time, both
  required), `tasks` (a relation to tasks, many) and `gcal_event_id` and
  `gcal_etag`. It is built in — it cannot be deleted — and is written into a
  vault once its tasks follow GTD (its Task type's status is the eight), as it
  opens or as soon as the move to GTD lands, never over one that is there,
  and said in Activity. A vault on statuses of its own is left as it is:
  writing a type into every vault with tasks changed what small vaults show
  first (the dashboard sheet's first type) for no use. Undoing the move to GTD
  leaves the Block type, which the move did not write. A write is never
  cancelled by the types being read again: what it did is said once, a
  failure only when every write for the vault has settled and none landed,
  and a vault is tried once until it is opened again. `gcal_missing` comes
  with sync (P31-04).
- **A one-task block gives that task its whole length.** A block of several
  is a container: when its tasks need at least the whole block it is shared
  in proportion to what each has left of its estimate; when they need less,
  each gets what it has left and the rest is shared equally among the tasks
  with no estimate, or stays free. "What it has left" is its estimate, or
  nothing once finished — not its estimate less time scheduled elsewhere,
  which would make one block's shares depend on every other block. Shares are
  whole minutes that add up to the block, the odd minute to the largest
  remainder, then the earliest listed — worked in exact integers, a
  remainder being `length × weight mod sum`, so equal remainders are equal
  however large the estimates. An estimate longer than a hundred years is
  read as none.
- **Blocks count on their own.** A task in two blocks that overlap is given
  both, and so reads as over-scheduled, rather than merged into less than was
  set aside. Past blocks count as well as future ones: no rule reads the
  clock.
- **A block is its wall-clock length as written**, as the calendar draws it:
  a block across midnight runs into the next day, and one across a
  daylight-saving change is as long as the clock says (01:30–03:30 is two
  hours on the night the clocks go forward). Nothing converts between zones,
  so the answer is the same on every Mac. A block without a time at both ends,
  or ending no later than it starts, gives nothing; it is not refused, since
  sync may pull such an event from Google.
- **For P31-04: blocks hold local wall-clock times, with no offset.** `start`
  and `end` are written `2026-10-12T09:00`, read as the time where the person
  is. A zone or offset written after the time (`…T09:00Z`, `…T09:00+02:00`) is
  currently ignored, as the calendar ignores it (`readEventTime`), so it is
  read as the same clock time. Sync must therefore convert Google's RFC 3339
  times to local wall-clock before writing a block, and convert the block's
  local times to RFC 3339 with the Mac's zone before pushing — never copy an
  offset into the note.
- **A task shows estimate, scheduled and done** under its properties, and
  how far it is over. Done comes from the status the Task type is ticked with
  (`archive` for GTD): all of the estimate once finished, none before.
  **Follow-up:** checklist progress (P30-03, #22, built on a sibling branch)
  is not read yet. Once it lands, done for an open task should be its
  estimate × the share of its checklist ticked, and a container's "what it
  has left" should follow. An estimate is minutes; `2h` and
  `1h30m` are read too, for a vault that kept a text estimate, but a day or a
  week is not — a day's working minutes are the person's to say.
- **No write rule is added.** Scheduling is read from blocks, never stored on
  a task, so the write chokepoints (ADR-0029) are unchanged.
- **Read from the index**: the tasks asked about, and every block linking any
  of them with all its tasks. Blocks are read a page at a time in order of
  their paths; a page the row cap cut short drops its last, possibly partial,
  block and the next page starts after the last whole one. Only a single
  block linking more tasks than the cap returns is refused, never answered
  short. The API reads the same with `POST /v1/query` and
  `schedule: true` (ADR-0016's P31-01 amendment).

Planning the day by dragging tasks onto the calendar:

- **The tray stands beside a calendar of blocks** — a view of the Block type
  drawn as a week, three days or a day — and lists the next actions as the
  Next actions view reads them (deferred ones stay out until their day), the
  ones with no time set aside yet first. A new calendar view of blocks spans
  each from its `start` to its `end`; switching an existing view to Calendar
  does not, since a view edit cannot set an end.
- **Let go on empty time, a task becomes a block** from the quarter hour the
  pointer is in, as long as what the task still needs — its estimate less
  what blocks give it and what is done — at most a day, and half an hour when
  it has no estimate or needs nothing more. Dragging the same task again makes
  another block for what is left: that is splitting. A drop made before the
  tray has read the last one counts it, so it gets what that one left. The
  block is a new note made through `createNote`, from the Block type's
  template when there is one, at the top of the vault, named "<task> block"
  (numbered when taken, the task's name cut by whole characters to fit a file
  name's 255 bytes), with `start` and `end` as wall-clock times with no
  offset. The target is what is under the pointer on this calendar's own
  clock, the pointer followed from its own moves — a scroll of the tray under
  a held task is not travel.
- **Let go on a block, the task joins its `tasks`**, linked after the others,
  which are written back as they were; a block already linking it, anywhere
  in an item as the index reads relations, is left alone, and so is a note
  that is not a block. The write goes through a pane holding the block, else
  `setNoteProperties` — the task-rule chokepoints — never to the file
  directly. A block drawn all day takes a task as a timed one does.
- **The keyboard has the same path**: Enter (or a click) on a task chooses it,
  focus goes to today's first hour, and Enter on an hour or a block places it;
  Escape lets it go, and so does the tray no longer listing it. The pointer
  drag takes no keys, since a held task has no step on the clock to make.
- **The last drop can be undone.** A block it made goes to the Trash while it
  holds exactly what the drop wrote and no pane holds typing in it not yet
  saved; otherwise it is left and the reason said. A task it linked is
  unlinked, the block's other links kept. The undo is kept for the vault the
  drop was made in only, is the last-started drop's when drops settle out of
  order, and runs once at a time.
- **A drag near the clock's edge does not scroll it**: the tray is not inside
  the clock's scroller. Scroll to the part of the day first.

The connection is built; syncing blocks (P31-04) is not. The host side is
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/google.rs` and `google/`; the rules are in
`packages/domain/src/google-calendar`; Settings → Google Calendar is the
card. Where the build went past or around the text above:

- **The flow.** RFC 8252 with PKCE (RFC 7636): a listener on `127.0.0.1`
  at a port the system picks, `S256` from a 32-byte verifier, and a 16-byte
  `state` compared in constant time. Only a redirect to `/` carrying this
  sign-in's `state` is acted on; any other request is answered with fixed
  text and ignored, so another program on the Mac can neither end the
  sign-in nor slip its own code into it. A redirect carrying an error and a
  code is a refusal. One sign-in waits at a time; it ends after five
  minutes or on Cancel. `access_type=offline&prompt=consent` is sent, or
  connecting again after a disconnect would bring back no refresh token.
- **The scope is `calendar.app.created`, not `calendar.events`.**
  `calendar.events` reaches every calendar on the account and cannot be
  narrowed to one. `calendar.app.created` lets Atlas make secondary
  calendars and change events on those alone — the "on that calendar only"
  the decision asks for — and Google lists it as non-sensitive. A consent
  screen lets the person untick a scope and still allow; a token without
  it is refused, revoked and not kept. Reading meetings for P31-05 will
  need a read scope added then, by incremental consent.
- **Where the tokens live, and where they may go.** The refresh token, with
  the client it was issued to and the scopes granted, is one Keychain item
  through the `SecretStore` every secret uses, scoped per vault as ADR-0017
  scopes secrets, at `<vault>:oauth/google`. It is deliberately not a
  named secret: a named secret can be filled into a source's request and
  rebound by the person in Settings → Secrets, and this token's
  destinations are the protocol's, not the person's. So the host pins them,
  the way `model_http` pins the Messages API: the refresh token goes only
  to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com` (`/token` to refresh, `/revoke` to
  revoke) — not `www.googleapis.com` as the decision says, because that is
  where Google's token endpoint is — and the access token, held in the
  host's memory only, goes only to `https://www.googleapis.com` under
  `/calendar/v3/`, checked after the path is parsed so `..` cannot climb
  out. No redirect is followed. The access token is renewed a minute
  before it expires, and a 401 renews it once.
- **The webview never sees a token.** It sees whether a sign-in is kept,
  its client and scopes, and a Calendar API answer with the access token
  struck from it. The PKCE verifier, the code, both tokens and any client
  secret stay in the host. A Rust test serializes every answer and failure
  the commands can hand back, with the API echoing its `Authorization`
  header, and finds none of them
  (`no_answer_or_failure_handed_to_the_webview_carries_a_token`); the IPC
  contract test pins the five Google commands.
- **Where the line is (ADR-0005).** The host holds the protocol and where a
  token may go: the endpoints, PKCE, `state`, the listener, the Keychain,
  and the token's lifetime. TypeScript decides the client, the scope, which
  Calendar calls to make and what their answers mean, which calendar holds
  blocks (one the person owns, never their main one), when to offer to make
  "Atlas blocks", and what each failure tells the person. The host reports
  a failure as a kind and Google's OAuth code; `explainGoogleFailure`
  words it.
- **The client ID is configuration.** Typed in Settings → Google Calendar
  and kept in the vault's settings (`google_client_id`), beside the chosen
  calendar (`google_calendar`), so both Macs use the same calendar; each
  Mac signs in for itself. No client ID is in this repository: James
  creates one in his own Google Cloud project (a Desktop app client, with
  the Calendar API enabled and the scope on its consent screen).
- **A client secret is optional, and never committed.** The task assumed a
  Desktop client with PKCE needs none. Google's documentation for installed
  apps says otherwise for the "Desktop app" client type: its token request
  lists `client_secret` as required, omitting it only for Android, iOS and
  Chrome-app clients, and says an installed app's secret is not treated as
  confidential. This could not be checked against Google here (the build
  talks only to a local fake), so Settings has a masked field for it, sent
  only when typed. It is kept in the Keychain item with the refresh token,
  never in the vault or the repo, and reused when connecting again with the
  same client. If Google accepts PKCE alone for the client, leave it empty.
- **Disconnect revokes and forgets.** RFC 7009 revocation of the refresh
  token, which ends its access tokens too; Google answering `invalid_token`
  (already revoked) counts as revoked. The Keychain item is removed even
  when Google cannot be told, and Settings then says to remove Atlas from
  the Google Account's third-party access.
- **Each vault's sign-in is serialised by a generation** (after review and
  an adversarial pass). Connecting and disconnecting move it on; a refresh
  saves its rotated refresh token and holds its access token only if the
  generation it started from is still current, checked and written under
  one lock. So a refresh still out when the person disconnects, or connects
  again, keeps nothing: the removed sign-in does not come back, a newer one
  is not overwritten, and no access token outlives a disconnect. A call
  whose refresh was discarded starts again from what is kept now. An
  `expires_in` past the clock's range is held for a day at most rather
  than panicking the command.
- **The browser's tab hears the truth.** The loopback answers the redirect
  only once the code is traded, the scope checked and the grant kept, so it
  says connected only when it is. A failed accept (out of descriptors, a
  reset) is waited out rather than ending the sign-in, and past 16
  connections no more are taken until one ends: a newcomer waits in the
  kernel's queue rather than being closed, since it may be the browser.
- **A sign-in other vaults may share is not revoked.** Google may revoke a
  whole grant — every token one person gave one client — rather than the
  single token it is sent; this is not verified here. Atlas asks for no
  identity scope, so it cannot tell which account a sign-in is for. When
  another vault on this Mac keeps a sign-in for the same client ID,
  disconnecting forgets this vault's and does not revoke it, and Settings
  says so; disconnecting the last one revokes.
- **An expired or revoked sign-in** comes back from the token endpoint as
  `invalid_grant`; Settings says to connect again, and that a sign-in which
  lapses every week means the Cloud project's consent screen is in Testing,
  where Google ends refresh tokens after seven days.
- **The local API and MCP expose status only**: whether Google Calendar is
  connected, never a token and no calendar call.
- **Still open — the spike the card asks for.** Whether James's Workspace
  allows a third-party client; whether this client needs its secret; and
  that `calendar.app.created` lists the calendars Atlas made through
  `calendarList`. Each is a configuration change or a one-line scope change
  if it turns out otherwise.
