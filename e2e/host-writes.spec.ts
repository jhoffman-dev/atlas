/**
 * Issue #5: the stub's `write_text_file` against two writes to one note at once.
 *
 * The Rust host's `write_text_file` is a synchronous command, so two of them
 * never interleave: the second sees the file the first wrote and is refused
 * when it names the time the note was read at before. The stub answers across
 * `await`s, and once let both writes pass that check and share one temporary
 * file — a write the host would refuse got through, and the note could end up
 * holding bytes neither writer sent. Every spec writes through this stub, so it
 * has to refuse exactly as the host does.
