/**
 * The list that appears under the caret for `[[` links and `/` commands.
 *
 * Deliberately not a Base UI popover, unlike the other three overlays of
 * ADR-0015. Every behaviour that ADR buys — trapping focus, restoring it,
 * owning open state, dismissing on an outside press, locking the page — is
 * wrong here. Focus must stay in the editor or the caret is lost, the popup is
 * anchored to a caret rectangle rather than to a trigger, and what is open and
 * what is selected are already owned by TipTap's suggestion plugin, which sees
 * the keystrokes before ProseMirror does. All a popover would add is anchored
 * positioning, at the cost of a second owner for the open state.
 *
 * The classes stay `suggest-option` / `atlas-suggestion`: TipTap's decoration
 * defaults to the class `suggestion`, and the collision once moved the caret to
 * column zero.
