 * task changed since keeps its change and is moved from where it now stands,

 * is written before any of them, so a run cut off partway can still be undone;
 * running again picks up what is left, and the one record covers both.
 *
 * Each file is written once, frontmatter only, through the host's refusal to
 * write over a file that changed after it was read. One that cannot be
 * written is reported and the rest carry on; a note with unsaved typing in a
 * pane is never written.
