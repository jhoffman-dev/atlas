/**
 * How many notes each quick view holds right now, for the count beside it.
 *
 * Each view is read from its file rather than from what the catalogue kept:
 * the index only hands back a view's marks, and counting a view without its
 * filters would count the wrong thing. A view that cannot be read or run gets
 * no count — the row still opens it, which is where its error belongs.
 *
 * The index counts a saved view, rather than handing back every row to be
 * counted here, and the count stops at the view's limit: the number beside a
 * view is how many it shows when opened. An Atlas query view (ADR-0019) — an
 * Inbox over tasks and meetings, say — is run as it is opened, and its rows
 * counted: its own LIMIT already stops it there.
