 * Answers the local API's requests as they arrive, until the returned function

 *
 * `onWrote` runs after each write a request makes lands — a file created or
 * written, or properties saved through a pane — so the sidebar, the views and
 * the index catch up the way they do after a write from the app itself. Reads
 * do not run it: every refresh moves the index on, and a tool that only
 * queries would otherwise keep every view on screen re-running.
