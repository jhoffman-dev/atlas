/**
 * Why a source may not run from where its note is, or null when it may.
 *
 * A source that sends a Keychain secret, or reads a SQLite file from outside
 * the vault, reaches things only the user should point it at. Anything that
 * can write a note in user space — the local API, a synced folder, a pasted
 * note — could otherwise aim the secret at a URL of its choosing, or copy any
 * database on the disk into notes it can read back. So such a source runs
 * only from `.atlas/sources`, which the API cannot write (ADR-0017). A plain
 * public feed, or a file inside the vault, runs from anywhere.
