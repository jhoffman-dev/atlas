 * The port this checkout's end-to-end server listens on.

 * Agents work in git worktrees, and every worktree used to share 4173. Refusing
 * to reuse a running server stopped one checkout silently testing another's
 * build, but not the contention: a suite run against a busy port took nearly
 * eight minutes and failed six tests that pass in sixteen seconds on their own.
 *
 * So each checkout gets its own port, derived from where it lives on disk. The
 * same checkout always gets the same port, and two checkouts almost never share
 * one — and when they do, `reuseExistingServer: false` below makes that a loud
 * refusal to start rather than a quiet wrong answer. `E2E_PORT` overrides it.
